‚Å†Football Score Prediction Using Advanced Models
Description:
This project focuses on predicting football match outcomes using advanced statistical models. Initially, the naive Poisson model is employed to predict match scores, but its limitations, such as assuming goal independence, lead to the exploration of more sophisticated methods. The Dixon-Coles model, which considers team strength, home advantage, and match dynamics, provides improved predictive accuracy. The project includes the statistical analysis and application of the Dixon-Coles model on Premier League datasets, showcasing techniques for accurate football score prediction.

Key Features:

Naive Poisson model vs. Dixon-Coles model.
Maximum likelihood estimation for parameter tuning.
Applied on real-world football data for score prediction.
Technologies: R, Statistical Modeling, Dixon-Coles Model
